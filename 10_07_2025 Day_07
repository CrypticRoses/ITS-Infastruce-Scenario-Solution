## ✅ Tasks Completed:
- Continued recovery from illness; workload was not resumed at full capacity.
- Reassessed timeline feasibility given loss of two full working days.
- Adjusted the internal project tracker and re-validated the priority list.

## ⚠️ Issues Faced
- Persistent fever prevented effective engagement with technical writing and research.
- Key tasks from both Days 5 and 6 remain pending:
  - Requirements Design
  - Technology Justification

## 📝 Reflection
Despite continued health-related downtime, the priority moving forward is structured catch-up.
Adjustments to the timeline, including working through buffer days or extending daily hours, will be necessary.
By doubling effort across the next 2–3 days, recovery is achievable.
