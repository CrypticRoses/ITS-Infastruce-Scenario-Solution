Using today to plan the rest of the week timeline , deal with some personal matters and build a timeline that is now more intesive and short due to me needing to move the 
deadline too the 17th for this work and my seperate cloud project. The timelinie will be logged on this file.

#Tasks Completed:
- Drafted a preliminary timeline and structure to guide progress on both the **Cloud** and **IT Security Infrastructure (ITS)** projects.
- Began distributing key tasks across upcoming days to manage workload more effectively.

## üìù Reflection
Initial planning helped bring clarity to project goals and dependencies. However, the timeline still needs refinement and the inclusion of buffer periods for unexpected delays.
This will be addressed incrementally as free time allows throughout the day.

## üìå Next Steps
- Continue refining the project schedule and add realistic buffers.
- Begin research into firewall technologies for selection and justification in the upcoming report section.
