## ✅ Tasks Completed:
- Maintained early wake-up and initiated the day with essential routines.
- Completed morning digital routines to maintain focus and momentum.
- Updated GitHub logs to reflect progress and maintained project tracking.
- Procured medical supplies (paracetamol) in response to recurring fever symptoms.
- Engaged in brief peer social interaction to maintain morale during recovery.

## ⚠️ Issues Faced:
- Continued to experience symptoms of fever and fatigue, impacting productivity.
- Afternoon and evening cognitive clarity was significantly impaired due to illness.
- Forgetfulness (e.g., misplacing Boots card) and diminished recall reflect disrupted cognitive rhythm.
- No project writing or technical implementation was completed.

## 📝 Reflection
Health complications persisted today, making sustained focus and output difficult.
Although light engagement with project logs and routines helped keep some momentum, no substantial academic progress was achieved.
These gaps will need to be compensated for in the following days with revised priorities and reallocated time blocks.
