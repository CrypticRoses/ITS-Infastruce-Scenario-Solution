# Project Overview: Designing and Securing IT Infrastructure for New Business Machine Ltd.
This project focuses on designing and implementing a secure IT infrastructure for **New Business Machine Ltd.
(NBM)**, a fictional e-commerce company specializing in the sale of electronic devices including laptops, computers, smartphones, and accessories.
NBM currently serves around **3,000 customers**, with expected growth to **15,000** in the short term and up to **25,000** within a year. 
This rapid growth demands an infrastructure that is **scalable, resilient, and security-focused** to ensure reliable service delivery and data protection.

## Scope of the Project
As part of this infrastructure development, I have chosen to focus on the **design and security of a firewall system**, which plays a critical role in safeguarding the company’s network by controlling and monitoring traffic between internal systems and the public internet.
In addition to the firewall, the project will also include the configuration of a **web server**, simulating a core public-facing component of NBM’s operations.
Together, these systems will form the foundation of a secure, scalable, and efficient IT environment tailored to meet the company’s current and future needs.

## Project Objectives
- **Design a secure firewall system** to act as the first line of defense against external threats and enforce internal network policies.
- **Deploy a web server** in a protected environment to simulate the company’s e-commerce platform.
- **Ensure scalability** to support the expected customer growth and increased system demands.
- **Implement security best practices**, including controlled access, encrypted communication, system monitoring, and routine updates.
