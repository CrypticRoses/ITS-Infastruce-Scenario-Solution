### ⚠️ Personal Note

Today was affected by a mix of personal and health-related challenges. I had prior commitments during the day and was feeling unwell. I also experienced some emotional difficulty reflecting on the funeral of a close colleague, which I was unable to attend due to work responsibilities taking priority.

## 📝 Reflection

While no technical work was completed today, the time away has reinforced the importance of maintaining a realistic and flexible schedule, particularly when balancing personal responsibilities with project goals.

## 📌 Next Steps

- Reassess the project timeline to account for today’s delay.
- Resume technical planning and decision-making for firewall and web server components on **Day 3**.
