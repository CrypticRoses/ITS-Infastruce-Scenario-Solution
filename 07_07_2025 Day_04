## ‚úÖ Tasks Completed:
- Followed an early version of the project timeline using a partially completed Excel planning sheet.
- Continued refining the **introduction section** of the report.
- Created a **color-coded version** of the project tracker in Excel to visually represent task status:
  - Categories include: **Expected**, **In Progress**, **Missed**, **Completed**
- Outlined a **rough structure** for all remaining report sections.
- Developed a **7-day structured work plan** aimed at completing the project by 14th July, with a built-in **2-day buffer** for flexibility and risk mitigation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Faced
- Encountered an administrative delay outside of the project scope, resulting in a loss of approximately 1.5 hours of available work time.
- Progress on improving the Excel tracking document was limited; although partially updated, it still requires formatting and task breakdown refinements.

## üìù Reflection
While the day involved some external disruptions, progress was made in key planning and reporting areas. 
Establishing a structured 7-day plan with buffers should enable steady progress and provide a clear direction moving forward.
The visual tracker, though still in development, is already helping clarify priorities.
