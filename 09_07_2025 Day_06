## ✅ Tasks Completed:
- Due to ongoing illness, no tangible project progress was made today.
- Reflected on remaining workload and began mentally outlining a revised path forward to stay within the original July 14th completion target.

## ⚠️ Issues Faced
- Illness significantly limited capacity to perform cognitive and technical tasks.
- The planned **Requirements Definition & System Design** and **Technology Selection & Justification** sections remained incomplete.
- Original work schedule now requires adjustment to accommodate missed days.

## 📝 Reflection
Health setbacks created a notable delay in the schedule, but with the built-in 2-day buffer and a willingness to intensify effort over the coming days,
project momentum can still be recovered. It is essential to stay disciplined and focused as health gradually improves.
