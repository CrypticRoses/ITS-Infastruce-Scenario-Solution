## ✅ Tasks Completed

- Attended a scheduled meeting, which limited uninterrupted working hours.
- Reviewed the project plan and identified the impact of lost time on today’s goals.
- Prepared for workload redistribution to maintain the overall timeline and completion target of July 14th.

## ⚠️ Issues Faced

- A delayed start due to health-related reasons reduced available productivity hours.
- Meeting commitments further limited time available for focused writing and technical work.
- As a result, the planned **Requirements Definition & System Design** section was not completed.

## 📝 Reflection

Today presented some unavoidable scheduling and health-related setbacks. 
However, thanks to the foresight of building a buffer into the 7-day plan, these disruptions can be mitigated with a slight redistribution of the workload. 
The remaining schedule has been updated to reflect realistic task groupings and time allocations while still preserving quality.
