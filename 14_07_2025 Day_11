## ✅ Tasks Completed:
- Maintained consistent wake-up time and began the day with routine productivity activities.
- Completed daily cognitive tasks across several platforms to stay mentally engaged.
- Sent an email to notify a healthcare professional of the need to cancel an in-person session due to workload constraints.
- Submitted an e-consult form for allergy-related medical follow-up.

## ⚠️ Issues Faced
- Experienced mental fatigue, which contributed to avoidance of core project work.
- Productivity was fragmented due to over-engagement with non-priority tasks (e.g extended digital routines).
- Despite completing routine tasks, limited progress was made on the project draft or technical work.

## 📝 Reflection
While essential health and administrative tasks were handled, the day lacked focused academic output.
 The inability to transition into project work highlights a need to reframe priorities and implement better structure for the remaining timeline.
With the assumed submission deadline still near, a strategic refocus is critical to avoid falling behind.
