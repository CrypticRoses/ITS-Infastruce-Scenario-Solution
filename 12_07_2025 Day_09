## ✅ Tasks Completed:
- Completed morning digital routines (Zenless Zone Zero, Arknights, Honkai).
- Maintained basic meal prep and domestic order despite minor setbacks (missing lighter).
- Coordinated delivery logistics and corrected a parcel issue intended for another address.
- Took initial steps to leave the house for fresh air and regain clarity.
- Continued hydration efforts and briefly attempted outdoor reset.

## ⚠️ Issues Faced:
- Alarm failed to trigger a timely wake-up, resulting in a later-than-ideal start.
- Fever symptoms returned sharply in the evening, significantly impairing productivity and mental clarity.
- Misplaced lighter delayed lunch preparation and impacted general mood.
- Delivery miscommunications and coordination fatigue further contributed to a sense of frustration.
- No core project tasks were completed today due to health limitations and low energy.

## 📝 Reflection
Today was another health-impaired day, marked by interrupted rhythm and a resurgence of fever. 
The impact on morale was noticeable, especially given the lack of visible progress on deliverables. 
However, routines were preserved in part, which helps maintain stability. Reallocating work to upcoming days is now necessary.
